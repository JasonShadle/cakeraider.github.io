# Resume

I liked the idea of having an online form of a resume as it is more convienent to link projects I am working on and go more in-depth if needbe on areas I want to focus on compared to a paper-form of it. The site uses a [template](https://github.com/RyanFitzgerald/devportfolio) I also found on GitHub, so I am going through and editing it. It uses Gulp which I am unfamiliar with, so I am bypassing those steps to just simplify it to HTML, CSS, and JS since that is what I am more comfortable with. Eventually I may incorportate it with Gulp, but currently it isn't used.
